Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **granular, testable, one-concern-per-task step-by-step plan** to build your AR web app MVP, aligned with the architecture we defined. Each task is small, focused, and has a clear beginning and end. This is designed specifically for sequential execution by an engineering LLM or dev bot, with human validation points after each.

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP MVP TASK LIST

### üü© PHASE 1: Project Setup

1. **Initialize project folder and dependencies**

   * Start: You have an empty folder.
   * End: Project initialized with `npm init`, and dependencies installed (`three`, `@mediapipe/hands`, `vite` or `webpack`, etc.).

2. **Create `index.html` with webcam video and root script tag**

   * Start: `public/index.html` is empty or missing.
   * End: `index.html` loads a full-screen webcam video and runs a basic `main.js` script.

3. **Create `main.js` entry file that logs page load**

   * Start: `main.js` does nothing.
   * End: `main.js` runs and logs a message like ‚ÄúApp loaded‚Äù.

### üü® PHASE 2: Webcam + MediaPipe Tracking

4. **Get webcam video stream in full screen**

   * Start: Webcam not active.
   * End: You see yourself mirrored full screen in the browser.

5. **Set up MediaPipe Hands and print landmarks**

   * Start: No hand tracking logic.
   * End: Hand landmarks are printed to console when hands are visible.

6. **Create `handTracking.js` to encapsulate tracking setup**

   * Start: Tracking logic is inline in `main.js`.
   * End: `handTracking.js` exports a setup function and a `subscribeToLandmarks` callback.

7. **Normalize and mirror landmark coordinates**

   * Start: Raw landmarks are unprocessed.
   * End: Landmarks are mirrored to match user‚Äôs view and normalized in 3D space.

---

### üü¶ PHASE 3: Three.js Scene + Rendering

8. **Create `ARCanvas.js` with a basic Three.js scene**

   * Start: No Three.js setup.
   * End: `ARCanvas` initializes a scene, camera, and renderer.

9. **Overlay Three.js canvas on top of webcam feed**

   * Start: Canvas is not visible or misplaced.
   * End: Canvas matches full screen and overlays the video.

10. **Add animation loop and confirm render updates**

    * Start: Static canvas.
    * End: Console logs or color-clear loop confirm animation frame updates.

---

### üüß PHASE 4: State System

11. **Create `StateManager.js` to store current effect and landmarks**

    * Start: No state abstraction.
    * End: `StateManager` has `getState`, `setEffect`, and `subscribe` API.

12. **Pipe hand landmarks into `StateManager`**

    * Start: Landmarks are printed only.
    * End: `StateManager` stores and updates them for use by effects.

13. **Create mock effect modules that log updates**

    * Start: No effect modules exist.
    * End: Each of the three effect modules logs when it receives updates.

---

### üü™ PHASE 5: Gesture Recognition + Switching

14. **Create `gestureUtils.js` and detect three gestures**

    * Start: No gesture detection.
    * End: Recognizes:

      * Open palm
      * Pinch
      * Index point

15. **Trigger effect switching from gesture recognizer**

    * Start: Only one effect active.
    * End: Effect switches on gesture, logged to console.

---

### üü´ PHASE 6: Implement MVP Effects

#### üîµ Effect 1: Colored Rings + Fire Trail

16. **Create ring geometry around fingertips**

    * Start: No 3D rings.
    * End: Rings follow all 5 fingertips in 3D.

17. **Add trail particles or fading lines from fingers**

    * Start: Static rings only.
    * End: Moving hand leaves a fading trail.

#### üü£ Effect 2: Pinchable Wireframe Flower

18. **Render wireframe flower at hand center**

    * Start: No flower object.
    * End: A wireframe object appears near the palm or between fingers.

19. **Detect pinch and move flower in 3D**

    * Start: Flower is static.
    * End: Pinching allows dragging the flower around.

#### üî¥ Effect 3: Colored Trail Lines from Index

20. **Draw a smooth line from index finger tip**

    * Start: Nothing follows finger.
    * End: Line follows finger smoothly using `Line2` or `LineSegments`.

---

### üü´ PHASE 7: UI + Help Overlay

21. **Create `HelpOverlay.js` UI component**

    * Start: No UI elements.
    * End: Overlay displays gesture -> effect mappings.

22. **Toggle overlay with a keyboard shortcut or gesture**

    * Start: Help always visible or missing.
    * End: Toggle help visibility with ‚ÄúH‚Äù or another gesture.

---

### üü© PHASE 8: Polish + MVP Validation

23. **Add basic CSS styling for layout and help**

    * Start: No CSS.
    * End: Everything is clean and full-screen.

24. **Test all three effects and switch interactions**

    * Start: Each effect works independently.
    * End: Switching and updating work in sequence.

25. **Final cleanup + prepare for demo**

    * Start: Loose ends and unused logs.
    * End: MVP is stable, presentable, and tested.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a **YAML version**, **Notion import**, or if you want each task to also include code stubs or expected test output.
